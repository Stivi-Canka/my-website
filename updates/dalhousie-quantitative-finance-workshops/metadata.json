  "fullText": "Since September, I've been running the Dalhousie Quantitative Finance Society (DQFS), the first student organization dedicated to quantitative finance education at Dalhousie University.\n\nWhat started as an idea has grown into one of the most active student organizations on campus, with more than 150 students involved so far. I've been organizing technical workshops covering Python programming for financial analysis, Excel VBA automation, derivatives pricing models, Power BI data visualization, and advanced quantitative methods. I've also been involved in organizing high-profile networking events connecting students with executives from major investment banks, hedge funds, and asset management firms.",
