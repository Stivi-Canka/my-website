                    <p>Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to teach programming to 20 high school girls as part of a STEM outreach program. What started as a way to give back to my community became one of the most transformative experiences of my life.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Walking into that classroom on the first day, I was nervous. How do you make coding accessible to students who might have never seen a line of code before? How do you break down complex concepts into digestible pieces? And most importantly, how do you make it fun?</p>

                    <p>I quickly realized that teaching programming isn't just about syntax and algorithms—it's about building confidence, fostering creativity, and showing students that they belong in the world of technology.</p>

                    <h2>Breaking Down Barriers</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest challenges was addressing the imposter syndrome that many of the students felt. "I'm not good at math," they'd say. "Coding seems too hard for me." I had to constantly remind them that programming isn't about being a math genius—it's about problem-solving, creativity, and persistence.</p>

                    <p>We started with simple projects: making a digital pet, creating a personal website, building a basic game. The key was to show them that they could create something meaningful from day one.</p>

                    <h2>The Breakthrough Moments</h2>
                    <p>There were moments that I'll never forget. The first time a student's code actually worked and she jumped up with excitement. The day when one of the quieter students confidently explained her project to the class. The moment when they realized they could build something that could help solve real-world problems.</p>

                    <p>These weren't just coding breakthroughs—they were confidence breakthroughs. Each success built on the last, creating a snowball effect of learning and growth.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>Teaching these students taught me more about programming than I ever expected. I learned that the best way to understand something is to explain it to someone else. I learned that there are many different ways to approach the same problem, and that diversity of thought makes us all better programmers.</p>

                    <p>Most importantly, I learned that representation matters. When students see someone who looks like them succeeding in tech, it changes what they believe is possible for themselves.</p>

                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                    <p>By the end of the program, these students weren't just writing code—they were thinking like programmers. They were breaking down problems, debugging systematically, and approaching challenges with confidence. Several of them have since pursued computer science in college, and a few have even started their own coding clubs at their schools.</p>

                    <p>The experience reminded me why I fell in love with programming in the first place: it's not just about the code—it's about the people you can help, the problems you can solve, and the communities you can build.</p>
