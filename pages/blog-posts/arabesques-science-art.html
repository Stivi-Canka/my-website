                    <h2>Physics</h2>
                    <p>Patterns emerge in sand on a metal plate vibrating at resonant frequencies. These exquisite patterns are a result of resonant modes created by standing acoustic waves on the metal plates. In other words, when the plate vibrates at just the right frequency, there are certain areas of the plate that actually "stand still" collecting the tiny bits of sand originally sprinkled onto the plate.</p>

                    <p>These patterns, known as Chladni figures, reveal the hidden geometry of sound. They demonstrate how invisible forces can create visible, beautiful structures—a perfect metaphor for the intersection of science and art.</p>

                    <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>Watching these patterns form, I was struck by their organic, flowing nature. They seemed to dance between mathematical precision and natural chaos, creating forms that felt both alien and familiar. This duality became the foundation for my generative art project: Arabesques.</p>

                    <p>The name "Arabesques" comes from the intricate, flowing patterns found in Islamic art—patterns that, like Chladni figures, seem to emerge from some deeper mathematical truth about the universe.</p>

                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <p>Using Processing and p5.js, I began experimenting with algorithms that could simulate the behavior of particles under the influence of harmonic forces. The goal wasn't to perfectly replicate Chladni figures, but to capture their essence—the way they seem to flow and dance across a surface.</p>

                    <p>Each piece starts with a simple mathematical function—a sine wave, a complex number, or a differential equation. From there, I let the algorithm explore the space, creating variations and mutations that feel organic and alive.</p>

                    <h2>The Result</h2>
                    <p>The final pieces exist somewhere between mathematics and mysticism. They're generated by code, but they feel like they could have been drawn by hand. They're precise, but they're also wild and unpredictable.</p>

                    <p>In creating these pieces, I've found a way to make the invisible visible—to show the hidden patterns that govern our universe, and to find beauty in the mathematics that surrounds us.</p>
