                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>As I walk through the Infinite Corridor for what feels like the thousandth time, I'm struck by how familiar these walls have become. The polished floors that have seen countless footsteps, the bulletin boards covered in research posters and event flyers, the hum of conversation that never quite stops—all of it has become a part of me.</p>

                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>When I first arrived at MIT, I was overwhelmed. The reputation, the expectations, the sheer intensity of it all. I remember sitting in my first lecture, surrounded by students who seemed to understand concepts that felt completely foreign to me. I wondered if I belonged here.</p>

                    <p>But MIT has a way of teaching you that you're capable of more than you ever imagined. The late nights in the library, the problem sets that seemed impossible until they weren't, the professors who pushed us to think beyond what we thought were our limits—all of it shaped me in ways I'm still discovering.</p>

                    <h2>The Community</h2>
                    <p>What I'll miss most about MIT isn't the academics (though those were incredible), but the people. The friends who became family, the study groups that turned into lifelong friendships, the professors who became mentors. There's something special about being surrounded by people who are genuinely excited about learning, who see problems as puzzles to be solved rather than obstacles to be avoided.</p>

                    <p>The diversity of thought and experience at MIT is unlike anywhere else. In a single day, you might have conversations about quantum computing, sustainable energy, and the philosophy of artificial intelligence. It's a place where the boundaries between disciplines blur, where innovation happens at the intersections.</p>

                    <h2>The Lessons</h2>
                    <p>MIT taught me that failure isn't the opposite of success—it's a necessary part of it. I learned to embrace the struggle, to find joy in the process of figuring things out. I learned that the best solutions often come from the most unexpected places, and that collaboration beats competition every time.</p>

                    <p>Most importantly, I learned that knowledge is only valuable when it's shared. The culture of open collaboration, of helping each other succeed, of using our skills to make the world better—that's what I'll carry with me.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>As I prepare to leave this place, I'm filled with gratitude and excitement. Gratitude for everything MIT has given me—the education, the experiences, the relationships. Excitement for what comes next, for the chance to apply everything I've learned to new challenges.</p>

                    <p>MIT will always be a part of me. The way I think about problems, the standards I hold myself to, the network of incredible people I'm now connected to—all of it is a gift that I'll never take for granted.</p>

                    <p>Thank you, MIT. For everything.</p>
